    Reads 2 files from provided paths, compares their content and prints diff.
    If compared lines in text files are similar enough (exceed cutoff) then extracts in-line diff.

    There are few possible strategies to choose to use independently in line-level and in-line-level diff:

        standard: uses built in python SequenceMatcher object to generate diff,
        elements movement detection not supported.

        heckel: detects elements movement in a human-readable form, might not catch all of moves and differences.

        displacement: detects all differences and movements, might not be very useful when both input files contains
        many common lines (for example many empty newlines).
